The task at hand is to rewrite the standard input/output POSIX library, "stdio.h", in C language, of course without using the library itself. After implementing fprintfx() and fscanfx(), which should perform just as fprintf() and fscanf() to write and read data buffers, the program also acquires a function clean() which closes all open files from the current processes file descriptor table.
